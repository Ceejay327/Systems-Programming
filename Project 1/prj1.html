<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>Project 1 is designed to give you a good feel for exactly how a
processor works. In Phase I, you will design a datapath to
implement a supplied instruction set architecture. You will use the
datapath as a tool to determine the control signals needed to
execute each instruction. In Phases II and III you are required to build a
simple finite state machine to control your computer and actually
run programs on it.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You will need to have a working knowledge of GT Logisim.
Make sure that you know how to make basic circuits as well as
subcircuits before proceeding. Also, make sure you have the most updated version of GT Logisim! It
can be found <a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/gt-logisim/downloads/list">here.</a></p>
 
<p>The assignment is broken up into three phases: </p> 

<ul type=disc> 
 <li>Phase I:</li> 
 <ul type=circle> 
  <li>Understand the ISA </li> 
  <li>Design and Implement the Datapath </li> 
 </ul> 
 <li>Phase II:</li> 
 <ul type=circle> 
  <li>Design and build your Microcontrol Unit </li> 
</ul>   
 <li>Phase III:</li> 
 <ul type=circle> 
  <li>Write the control program. </li> 
  <li>Convert to hex (with a supplied tool)  </li> 
  <li>Hook up the state machine and run your computer. </li> 
  <li>Test and Debug</li>
 </ul> 
</ul> 

<p>But first you need to see the detailed specification of the
Instruction Set Architecture or ISA </p>

<h3>The LC-2200 Instruction-Set Architecture </h3>

<p>The LC-2200-16 (Little Computer 2200-16 bits) is very simple,
but it is general enough to solve complex problems. (Note: This is
a 16-bit version of the ISA specification you will find in the
Ramachandran &amp; Leahy textbook for CS 2200.)&nbsp; This section
describes the instruction set and instruction format of the
LC-2200. The LC-2200-16 is a 16-register, 16-bit computer. All
addresses are word-addresses. </p>

<p>Although, the 16 registers are known as general purpose they are
generally assigned special duties by software convention. </p>

<p>Register 0: This register will always contain zero when read
from. As an additional feature it may be written to in those cases
where a value is not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> For the purposes of this project, you must implement
the zero register. Regardless of what is written to this register,
it should always output zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Register 1: Although this is a general purpose register by
convention, programmers should not use it. It may be used by the
assembler when processing pseudo-instructions. </p>
<p>Register 2: Is designated as the register used to return
values from functions. </p>
<p>Registers 3-5: Are designated to be used for passing
arguments to functions.</p>
<p>Registers 6-8: Are designated for temporary variables.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> When calling a function the programmer should assume
that the contents of registers 2-8 that were present when the call
was made will no longer be valid. Thus, if needed after the call
those values should be saved by the programmer calling the
function. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Registers 9-11: These are saved registers.The caller
of a function may assume that once the function returns the values
that were in these registers before the call will still be there.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> This implies that a programmer writing a function that
wishes to use these registers should first save them (most likely
on the activation stack), then use them and then restore them
before returning control to the caller </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Register 12: This register is reserved for handling
interrupts. </p>
<p>Register 13: The stack pointer which is used to keep track of
the location of the top of the activation stack. </p>
<p>Register 14: This is the frame pointer discussed in the class
and covered in the textbook. You can ignore it for this project.
</p>
<p>Register 15: When a function is called the JALR instruction
will save the address to return to and by convention this register
is used for that purpose. </p>
<h4>Instructions </h4>
<p>There are 4 instruction formats (bit 0 is the least-
significant bit). </p>
<pre>
R-type instructions (add, nand):

bits 15-13: opcode
bits 12-9: RX
bits 8-5: RY
bit 4: unused
bits 3-0: RZ
</pre>
<br/>
<pre>
I-type instructions (addi, lw, sw, beq):

bits 15-13: opcode
bits 12-9: RX
bits 8-5: RY
bits 4-0: offsetField (a 5-bit, 2's complement number with a range of -16 to +15)
</pre>
<br/>
<pre>
J-type instructions (jalr):

bits 15-13: opcode
bits 12-9: RX
bits 8-5: RY
bits 4-0: unused (should all be 0)
</pre>
<br/>
<pre>
S-type instructions (halt):

bits 15-13: opcode
bits 12-0: unused (should all be 0)
</pre>
<p>Symbolic instructions should follow the same layout. For
example, the add instruction is written in assembly as:<br></b>
<code>add</b></code>&lt;RX&gt;&lt;RY&gt;&lt;RZ&gt;</b></p>

<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1: Description of Machine Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------
Assembly language
Opcode (binary name for instruction)        Action
(bits 15-13)
------------------------------------------------------------------
add (R-type format)  000
Add contents of RY with contents of RZ, store results in RX.
format: add RX, RY, RZ
ex: add $v0, $a0, $a1
 
nand (R-type format) 001
Nand contents of RY with contents of RZ, store results in RX.
format: nand RX, RY, RZ
ex: nand $v0, $a0, $a1
 
addi (I-type format) 010
Add contents of RY to contents of offset field and store result in RX.
format: addi RX, RY, offsetField
ex: addi $v0, $a0, 25
 
lw (I-type format)  011
Retrieves data from memory location [RY+offsetField] and loads that data into RX.
format: lw RX, offsetField(RY)
ex: lw $v0, 0x42($sp)
 
sw (I-type format) 100
Retrieves data from RX and stores that data in memory location [RY+offsetField]
format: sw RX, offsetField(RY)
ex: sw $a0, 0x42($sp)
 
beq (I-type format) 101
Compare the contents of RX  and RY; if they are the same, then branch to
the address PC+1+offsetField, where PC is the address
of the beq instruction.
format: beq RX, RY, offsetField
ex: beq $a0, $a1, done
 
jalr (J-type format) 110
First store PC+1 into RY where PC is the address of the jalr instruction.
Then branch to the address now contained in RX. Note that if RX is the
same as RY, the processor will first store PC+1 into that register,
then end up branching to PC+1.
format: jalr RX, RY
ex: jalr $at, $ra
 
halt (S-type format)  111
Halts the processor.
ex: halt</pre> 
 
<p>Like many processors an
assembler for the LC-2200-16 would supply a number of pseudo instructions: </p> 
<pre>noop - No operation: does nothing
ex: noop (actually emits add $zero, $zero, $zero)
 
.byte (pseudo-op) - fill word with a value.
ex: .byte  32</pre> 
 
<p>The assembler supports labels which represent the address of the line.
If a label is used in a beq instruction, it will evaluate to the
relative offset. </p> 
 
<pre>Example:
(address 0):       add  $s0, $zero, $zero
(address 1): loop: addi $s0, $s0, -1
(address 2):       beq  $s0, $zero, end
(address 3):       beq  $zero, $zero, loop
(address 4): end:  halt
 
becomes
 
(address 0): 000 1001 0000 0000 0 or  0x1200
(address 1): 010 1001 1001 11111  or  0x533F
(address 2): 101 1001 0000 00001  or  0xB201
(address 3): 101 0000 0000 11101  or  0xA01D
(address 4): 111 00000000000 00   or  oxE000
</pre> 

 
<h3>Assignment Phase I</h3> 
 
<ul type=disc> 
  <li>Understand the ISA </li> 
  <li>Design and Implement the Datapath </li> 
</ul> 
 
<h4>Learn how the datapath works</h4> 
 
 
<img border=0 src="Images/lc2200datapath.png"></p>

<p><b>Figure 1: LC-2200 Datapath</b></p>

 
<p>The first thing you must do is to build your basic LC-2200-16 datapath. 
The basic operation of the
datapath will be discussed in class. As you construct your datapath, 
build in as much functionality that will allow you to operate it "by hand"
to allow you to experiment and test the operation.</p> 
 
<p>We suggest your datapath might include devices to allow you to arbitrarily put a
value on the bus as well as view the current value of the bus. Feel free to add
any additional bells and whistles (maybe LEDs would be better) that you desire
to help you understand what is going on.</p> 

<h4>Tips:</h4>
<ul type=disc> 
  <li>You will have to build your own ALU. Recall that it must support A + B, A nand B, A-B and A+1.</li> 
  <li>Logisim has single registers but doesn't have a register file. You can choose to 
  either use a block of RAM to act as your register file or you can build your own. 
  <b>Remember that, in either case, you must make R0 ($zero) a zero register (i.e. no matter what attempt to load into that register, it should ALWAYS output "0").</b></li> 
</ul> 

<h4 align="center"></h4>
<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
<h4 align="center"></h4>

<h3>Assignment Phase II:</h3>
<ul type=disc> 
  <li>Design and Build the microcontrol unit</li> 
</ul> 

<p>This semester, you have <b>two choices for Phases II and III of this project.</b> In Phases II and III, you will be building a microcontrol unit which will control all of the signal lines to the various parts of the datapath. </p>

<p>For standard credit, you will be building a very simple
control unit that simply consists of a single ROM and a register.
If you wish to do this, keep reading the next section. &nbsp;This
is very similar to the class discussion and coverage in the
textbook.</p>

<p>However, <b>for an additional 10 possible points</b>, you can choose
to implement a three ROM microsequencer. This version of the
microcontrol unit is a bit more complicated, but it is a MUCH more
efficient use of total ROM space. If you want to do this, skip down
to the "Bonus" section. </p>

<p>Note that, while the microcode does not change very much
between the two versions, the format of how you need to write the
microcode is different since we use two different programs to
generate the HEX files that you will put into the ROM(s). See the
README files in the respective folders for details. </p>


<h4 align="center"></h4>
<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
<h4 align="center"></h4>


<h4>Design and Build the Microcontrol Unit - STANDARD VERSION</h4>
<p>SM control units may be implemented in a number of ways:
Combinational logic combined with a state element such as a
register may be used. Quite common in practice are microcode
designs where the information for each state is stored in a ROM.
For this project, we suggest a simple version of the microcode
approach. Examine figure 2.<br>


<br> <b><img border="0" width="720" height="540" id=
"_x0000_i1031" src="Images/rom_fsm_control.png"></b></p>
<p><b>Figure 2: Single-ROM Microcontrol Unit</b></p>
<p>This approach combines a ROM with a register. Operation is
simple. The current state is stored in a register as a number. The
bits from this register are combined with opcode bits, other bits
from the datapath (e.g., Z register) and all together these bits
form an address. The contents of that address are bits that are
used to specify all control signals to the datapath as well as the
number of the next state. The new state gets stored at the end of
the clock cycle. </p>


<p>Before getting down to specifics you need to determine the
control scheme for the datapath. To do this, examine each
instruction, one by one, and construct a finite state bubble
diagram showing exactly what control signals will be set in each
state. Also, determine what are the conditions necessary to pass
from one state to the next. Experiment with the supplied datapath
to make sure that your logic is sound. </p>


<p>Once the finite state bubble diagram is produced, the next
step is to encode the contents of the Control Unit ROM with a tool
we are providing. Then you must design and build (in GT Logisim)
the Control Unit circuit which will contain one ROM, a MUX, and a
state register. Your design will be better if it allows you to
single step and insure that it is working properly. Finally, you
will load the Control Unit's ROM with the output of the tool.
</p>
<p>Here is a table defining the bits you should use for your
control logic: </p>
<p><b>Note: The control signals listed here are ever so slightly
different than those in the Bonus version, so if you decide to
switch versions, make sure you account for that. </b></p>

<h4>Design and Build the Microcontrol Unit - BONUS VERSION</h4>

<p><b>If you choose to complete this version of the project, you can earn
up to 10 bonus points</b></p>

<p>You will make a Microcontrol Unit which will drive control of
the signal lines to the various items on the datapath.</p>

<p>FSM control units may be implemented in a number of ways:
Combinational logic combined with a state element such as a
register may be used. Quite common in practice are microcode
designs where the information for each state is stored in a ROM.
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the simple, single-ROM solution has a lot
of wasted space in the ROM since most of the microstates do not
depend on the OP code or the Z register to determine which signals
to assert. For example, since Z register is an input for the
address, every microstate would have to have an address for Z = 0
as well as Z = 1, even though this only matters for one particular
microstate. </p>

<p>To solve this problem, we will use a three ROM
microcontroller. In this arrangement, we have three ROMs - the main
ROM, which outputs the control signals, the sequencer ROM, which
helps to determine which microstate to go at the end of the FETCH
state, and the OnZ ROM, which helps to determine whether or not to
branch during the BEQ instruction. See the following figure.
</p>


<h4><br>
<img border="0" width="716" height="631" id="_x0000_i1030" src=
"Images/three_rom_controller.png"></h4>

<p><b>Figure 3: Three ROM Microcontrol Unit</b></p>

<p>As you can see, there are three different locations that the
next state can come from - part of the output from the previous
state (main ROM), the sequencer ROM, and the OnZ ROM. The mux
controls which of these sources gets through to the state register.
If the previous state's "next state" field determines where to go,
neither the OPTest nor chkZ signals will be asserted. If the Op
Code from the IR determines the next state (such as at the end of
the Fetch state), the OpTest signal will be asserted. If the
zero-detection circuitry determines the next state (such as in the
BEQ instruction), the TestZ signal will be asserted. Note that
these two signals should never be asserted at the same
time since nothing is input into the "11" pin on the MUX.</p>

<p>Since we no longer consider the OpCode and zero detection as
part of our input for the main ROM, the main ROM can be
significantly smaller - more specifically, one address per
microstate. The OpCheck ROM should have one address per
instruction, and the OnZ ROM should have one address for taking the
branch and one for not taking the branch. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> GT Logisim has a minimum of two address bits for a ROM (i.e. four addresses),
even though only one address bit (two addresses) is needed for the OnZ ROM. Just
ignore the other two addresses. You may want to do something so
that the high address bit for this ROM is permanently set to zero.
</p>

<p>Before getting down to specifics you need to determine the
control scheme for the datapath. To do this examine each
instruction, one by one, and construct a finite state bubble
diagram showing exactly what control signals will be set in each
state. Also determine what are the conditions necessary to pass
from one state to the next. Experiment with the supplied datapath
to make sure that your logic is sound. </p>

<p>Once the finite state bubble diagram is produced, the next
step is to encode the contents of the Control Unit ROM with a tool
we are providing. Then you must design and build (in GT Logisim)
the Control Unit circuit which will contain the three ROMs, a MUX,
and a state register. Your design will be better if it allows you
to single step and insure that it is working properly. Finally, you
will load the Control Unit's ROMs with the output of the tool.
</p>

control logic: </p>

<ul type=disc> 
  <li>Write the control program. </li> 
  <li>Convert to hex (with a supplied tool)  </li> 
  <li>Hook up the state machine and run your computer. </li> 
  <li>Test and Debug</li>
 </ul> 
 

<p><b>Make sure that you are using the tools in the folder that
correspond to the version of the project that you are completing.
</b></p>

<ul type=disc> 
 
<li>Write the microcode control program and convert it to a hex
file suitable for loading into your control unit's ROM(s). See the
README file in the appropriate folder (Standard or Bonus) for more
information about the supplied conversion tools.</li>

<li>Connect the Control Unit to the Datapath, load your control
program into the Control Unit ROM(s), load a short test program
into the RAM (See README-assembler.txt) and start running your computer. Some debugging may be
necessary at this point. The easiest way to debug is to write
simple assembly programs that test one particular instruction at a
time. </li>

<li>Turn in your completed datapath, your microcode (the
.fsm file for the standard version or the .xml file for the bonus 
version) in plain text. Do not turn in the
compiled HEX files. Your datapath file does not reliably save state
in between closing and reopening the file, so if you do not turn in
BOTH your datapath and your microcode file (.fsm or .xml
depending), we will not be able to fully grade your project! Make
sure your name and gtnumber, are visible on your datapath. </li>

<li>Sign up for a demo timeslot. Watch for T-Square announcements
and pay attention in class. You will be required to sign up for a
demo time after the turn-in deadline for the project. At this demo,
you will be asked questions to determine your level of
understanding of the project material. Attendance at your demo time
is mandatory.</li></ul>
