# Systems-Programming
This repository showcases my journey through the CS 2200 curriculum, focusing on processor design and systems programming. It includes five projects, each documented with detailed explanations of the design process, challenges faced, and insights gained.

## Project 1 - Implementing an Augmented 16-bit LC-2200 Datapath
This was a fun, hands-on way of creating a processor mostly from scratch. While I obtained a general understanding of datapath design from a prerequisite course offered at my college (CS 2110), how the control unit facilitates the processor stepping through sequential, repeatable states remained a mystery to me until now. That was a responsiblity handed to this course, and seeing it all come together is truly fulfilling.
